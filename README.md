I've heard that creating a neural network that can identify numbers is the "Hello, world!" of machine learning. So, after watching the first few videos of 3Blue1Brown's awesome machine learning series, I wanted to try and recreate the neural network that he used in the video by essentially taking his explaination and turning it into code. This network will use 28 x 28 pixel images as the dataset to learn on.
